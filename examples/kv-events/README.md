# KVCacheIndex Use Example

The code in main.go showcases how to configure and use a KVCacheIndex module.
The code assumes that you have a Redis instance that is already fed with KVBlock -> Pods mappings.

For instructions on setting up an example environment for this demonstration, please refer to [docs/deployment/setup.md](../../../docs/deployment/setup.md).
