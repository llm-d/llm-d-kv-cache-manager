# KV-Cache Indexer: Architecture

The **KV-Cache Indexer** is a high-performance library that keeps a global, near-real-time view of KV-Cache block locality across a fleet of vLLM pods. 
Its purpose is the enablement of smart routing and scheduling by exposing a fast, intelligent scoring mechanism for vLLM pods based on their cached KV-blocks.

-----

## System Architecture

The Indexer is built from several modules that work together, each with clear responsibilities.
Separating concerns is a guiding principle in the design of this system.

| Module | Purpose                                                      | Default Implementation                                          |
| :--- |:-------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`kvcache.Indexer`** | The main orchestrator that handles scoring requests          | Coordinates all internal modules                                |
| **`kvevents.Pool`** | Ingests and processes KV-cache events from vLLM pods         | A sharded worker pool using ZMQ for event subscription          |
| **`kvblock.Index`** | The core data store mapping KV-block hashes to pod locations | An in-memory, two-level LRU cache                               |
| **`tokenization.PrefixStore`**| Caches tokenized prompt prefixes to avoid re-work            | An LRU cache storing text chunks and their corresponding tokens |
| **`kvblock.TokenProcessor`**| Converts token sequences into KV-block keys                  | Uses a chunking and hashing algorithm compatible with vLLM      |
| **`kvblock.Scorer`** | Scores pods based on the sequence of cache hits              | Implements a longest consecutive prefix matching strategy       |

## Data Flow & Processes

The system has two primary data flows: the **Read Path** for scoring pods and the **Write Path** for ingesting cache events.

### Read Path: Scoring a Prompt

When a router needs to pick the best pod for a new prompt, it triggers the Read Path. 
The goal is to find the pod that has the longest sequence of relevant KV-blocks already in its cache.
A list of pods with their scores is returned to the router.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Router as Router/Scheduler
    participant Indexer as kvcache.Indexer
    participant PrefixStore as tokenization.PrefixStore
    participant TokenProcessor as kvblock.TokenProcessor
    participant Index as kvblock.Index
    participant Scorer as kvblock.Scorer

    Router->>Indexer: GetPodScores(prompt, model, pods[])
    
    Note over Indexer: Synchronously tokenizes prompt using pool if not in prefix cache
    Indexer->>PrefixStore: FindLongestContainedTokens(prompt, model)
    PrefixStore-->>Indexer: cachedTokens[]
    
    Indexer->>TokenProcessor: TokensToKVBlockKeys(cachedTokens[], model)
    TokenProcessor-->>Indexer: blockKeys[]
    
    Indexer->>Index: Lookup(blockKeys[], podSet)
    Index-->>Indexer: hitKeys[], keyToPodsMap
    
    Indexer->>Scorer: Score(hitKeys[], keyToPodsMap)
    Scorer-->>Indexer: podScoresMap
    
    Indexer-->>Router: podScoresMap[string]int
```

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Token Retrieval**: The `Indexer` first checks the `PrefixStore` for the longest token sequence it has for the prompt's prefix. If the prompt isn't cached or coverage is insufficient, it performs synchronous tokenization using the worker pool.
2.  **Key Generation**: The retrieved tokens are sent to the `TokenProcessor`, which chunks and hashes them into a sequence of deterministic KV-block keys that match vLLM's logic.
3.  **Index Lookup**: With the keys, the `Indexer` queries the `kvblock.Index` to see which pods have them. The lookup is optimized to find the longest *consecutive* chain of hits from the start.
4.  **Scoring**: The `Scorer` takes the hit data and scores each pod based on its number of consecutive matching blocks.
5.  **Response**: A final map of pod scores is sent back to the router.

Note: The tokenization pool now supports both asynchronous (fire-and-forget) and synchronous modes, ensuring scoring requests can always return complete results.

### Write Path: Processing Cache Events

The Write Path keeps the index up-to-date by processing a constant stream of events from the vLLM fleet.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant vLLM as vLLM Pod
    participant Subscriber as kvevents.zmqSubscriber
    participant Pool as kvevents.Pool
    participant Worker as Pool Worker
    participant Index as kvblock.Index

    vLLM->>Subscriber: Publishes ZMQ Message (msgpack encoded)
    Note over Subscriber: Topic parsed to get Pod ID & Model: kv@pod-id@model
    
    Subscriber->>Pool: AddTask(Message)
    Note over Pool: Hashes pod-id (FNV-1a) to select a worker shard
    
    Pool->>Worker: Enqueues message
    
    Worker->>Worker: Decodes EventBatch (BlockStored, BlockRemoved, etc.)
    loop For each event
        alt BlockStored
            Worker->>Index: Add(keys[], podEntry)
        else BlockRemoved
            Worker->>Index: Evict(key, podEntry)
        else AllBlocksCleared
            Note over Worker: No-op
        end
    end
```

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Event Publication**: A vLLM pod emits an event, like `BlockStored`, when its cache changes. The event is published to a ZMQ topic.
2.  **Message Reception**: The `zmqSubscriber` receives the message and parses the topic to get the `podIdentifier` and `modelName`.
3.  **Sharded Queuing**: The message goes to the `kvevents.Pool`, where the pod identifier is hashed (using FNV-1a) to select a specific worker queue. This guarantees that events from the same pod are always processed in order.
4.  **Event Decoding**: A worker pulls the message and decodes the msgpack payload, which can contain a batch of events.
5.  **Index Update**: The worker applies the event to the `kvblock.Index`, either adding a new block location or evicting an old one.

## Component Deep Dives

#### KV-Block Hashing & Generation

To guarantee compatibility, the indexer perfectly matches vLLM's content-addressing logic.

* **Token Chunking**: Prompts are converted to tokens, which are then grouped into fixed-size chunks (default: 16).
* **Hash Algorithm**: A chained hash is computed. Each block's key is the **lower 64 bits of a SHA-256 hash**, generated from the CBOR-encoded `[parentHash, tokenChunk, extraKeys]` tuple.
* **Initialization**: The hash chain starts with a configurable `HashSeed`. This value's source **must** align with the `PYTHONHASHSEED` environment variable in the vLLM pods to ensure hashes are consistent across the entire system.

#### Index Backends

The `kvblock.Index` is an interface with swappable backends.

* **In-Memory (Default)**: A very fast, thread-safe, two-level LRU cache using `hashicorp/golang-lru`. The first level maps a block key to a second-level cache of pods that have the block. It prioritizes speed over persistence, which is usually the right trade-off for ephemeral cache data.
* **Cost-Aware Memory (Optional)**: A memory-efficient implementation using the `hypermodeinc/ristretto` cache library that provides cost-aware eviction based on actual memory usage. Unlike the basic in-memory backend, this implementation calculates the memory footprint of each cache entry and uses this information for intelligent eviction decisions. This is particularly useful when memory usage patterns vary significantly across different keys.
* **Redis (Optional)**: A distributed backend that can be shared by multiple indexer replicas. It can offer scalability and persistence, but this may be overkill given the short lifetime of most KV-cache blocks.

#### Tokenization Caching Process

The tokenization pool implements a cache-aware strategy to optimize prompt processing:

**How Tokenization Caching Works:**

1. **Prefix Cache Lookup**: For each tokenization request, the pool first queries the prefix store to find cached tokens
2. **Coverage Calculation**: The overlap ratio is calculated as `covered_characters / total_prompt_length`
3. **Threshold Decision**: 
   - If `ratio >= minPrefixOverlapRatio`: Return cached prefix tokens (fast path)
   - If `ratio < minPrefixOverlapRatio`: Perform full tokenization and cache the result (slow path)
4. **Prefix Cache Update**: Full tokenizations are stored in the prefix store for future reuse
5. **KV Cache Lookup**: The resulting tokens are converted to KV-block keys for scoring

**Configuration Impact:**

The `minPrefixOverlapRatio` parameter controls the trade-off:
- **Lower values**: Accept shorter cached prefixes, reduce full tokenization overhead, potentially less accurate
- **Higher values**: Require better prefix coverage, more accurate results, less prefix cache utilization

#### Tokenization Subsystem

Efficiently handling tokenization is critical for performance. The system is designed to tokenize prompts quickly using a worker pool that supports both asynchronous and synchronous operations. It relies on a `PrefixStore` to cache tokenization results and avoid redundant work.

* **Tokenization Pool**: The `tokenization.Pool` provides both asynchronous (fire-and-forget) and synchronous tokenization modes. For scoring requests, synchronous tokenization ensures complete results are always returned. The pool uses a configurable number of workers to process requests efficiently.
* **Tokenizer Caching**: The actual tokenization is handled by a `CachedHFTokenizer`, which wraps Hugging Face's high-performance Rust tokenizers. To avoid the overhead of repeatedly loading tokenizer models from disk, it maintains an LRU cache of active tokenizer instances.
* **PrefixStore Backends**: The token cache (`PrefixStore`) is an interface with two available implementations:
    * **`LRUTokenStore` (Default)**: This implementation chunks incoming text, hashes it, and stores blocks of tokens in an LRU cache. It's fast and memory-bounded, making it a reliable default. It's designed to find the longest chain of *blocks* that match a prompt's prefix.
    * **`TrieTokenStore`**: An alternative implementation that uses a character-based trie. Each node in the trie stores information about the last token that was fully contained within the prefix leading to that node. This approach can be more memory-efficient for prompts with highly repetitive or overlapping prefixes, but is generally slower than the LRU-based store. 
    It is not the default due to its higher complexity and lower performance in most scenarios.
